# Heart_Disease_Prediction 
**Overview** 
Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

Developed a predictive model to classify the likelihood of heart disease using patient health records (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, etc.).

Performed data preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, feature engineering) and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key risk factors.

Implemented and compared multiple machine learning algorithm like Logistic Regression , Linear Regression, Random Forest Classifier to evaluate model performance.

Delivered a scalable and reproducible pipeline for healthcare prediction tasks.
